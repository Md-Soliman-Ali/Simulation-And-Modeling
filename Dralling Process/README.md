Experiment name: Simulation of the drilling process in a manufacturing plant.

Introduction: Plant operation requires that multiple process operations are coordinated to work at maximum efficiency. If your production line is unbalanced, the result can be increased WIP, higher off-grade material, and a reduction in plant throughput. Logistics inefficiencies can also increase costs when production must stop due to resource constraints or available storage capacity. Simulation can help you optimize the plant processes to reduce costs and improve throughput.

Procedure: 
1.Parts arrival: The parts will come in it. We will set a name as parts, in time between arrival value set and unit set as minutes. Then we will leave the rest of the setup as it is in the system. 
2.Drilling process: In the process, the parts will drilling by the machine. We will set the process name as parts drilling and action set.
3.Parts finish: Dispose the parts after drilling. We will set the disposal name parts finished. 

Conclusion and Discussion: Arena is a very versatile integrated simulation tool. Constructing the drilling process in a manufacturing plant simulation model involves one or more flow objects known as entities and flow through the system and the building flow chart of the model using Arenaâ€™s flowchart modules. The model is then enhanced by editing some of the data modules. Arena provides a simple method to set up the simulation parameters and the model input parameters. After completing all procedures, we will run the model, and then we will get the report.
